        <p class = "disc"> During my time at ADA Analytics from December to April, I had the exciting opportunity to work on the backend development team.<br> Our main project was an 
        ambitious overhaul of the company's website, aiming to revamp it based on new UX/UI prototypes we meticulously designed. 
        </p>
        <p class = "disc">
        My contributions were centered around developing robust backend functionalities using FastAPI. I created efficient backend endpoints and ensured their 
        reliability through comprehensive unit tests using pytest. <br>Additionally, I documented all endpoint APIs and utilized Pydantic models for precise response 
        types, ensuring our system's integrity and scalability. <br> This experience not only honed my technical skills but also deepened my understanding of 
        integrating backend solutions with modern web design principles. <br> It was a highly rewarding and intellectually stimulating experience that enhanced my expertise 
        in backend development and web technologies.
