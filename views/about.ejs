    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I've always had a love-hate relationship with computers: I love them when they work and hate them when they don’t. After high school, I flirted with the idea of understanding how these mysterious boxes worked. 
       But life had other plans, and I took a two-year hiatus. Like all great stories, though, mine had a comeback! In the summer of 2022, I rekindled that old flame and dove headfirst into the world of technology 
       by joining Western University to pursue a degree in Computer Science and Political Science.</p>
       
    <p>Now, I’m deeply immersed in the <strong>data field</strong>, exploring the intersection of <strong>data development</strong>, <strong>machine learning</strong>, and <strong>AI</strong>. My work with companies like <strong>ADA Analytics</strong> and <strong>Maskwa Gourmet Foods</strong> 
       sharpened my skills in <strong>backend development</strong> and <strong>data management</strong>. Starting <strong>May 2025</strong>, I’ll be a <strong>Data Developer intern at Celestica</strong>, where I’ll work closely with <strong>Oracle</strong> and <strong>Power BI</strong>, blending 
       my passion for data with AI-driven solutions to create impactful, real-world applications. What began as a casual interest in computers has turned into a dynamic journey of building smart, data-powered technologies.</p>

    <h1>Technical Expertise in Front-End and Web Development</h1>
    <p>My passion for front-end development and web development is evident through my technical expertise and project experiences. I am proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks such as <strong>NodeJS</strong>,
         <strong>ReactJS</strong>, and <strong>ExpressJS</strong>. I have successfully designed and developed over five websites, constantly working on ongoing projects to refine my skills further. Additionally, my knowledge extends to 
         mobile development using <strong>React Native</strong> and <strong>Swift</strong>, demonstrating my versatility in handling various platforms. I have developed critical features like login/logout functionalities, chat 
         capabilities, and mentor-teacher matching systems, showcasing my ability to build robust and user-friendly applications.</p>

    <h1>Proficiency in Programming and Database Management</h1>
    <p>Moreover, I am well-versed in multiple programming languages, including <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>Java</strong>, <strong>C</strong>, <strong>C++</strong>, and <strong>Swift</strong>, which has enabled me to tackle a wide range of software development challenges. 
        My experience with database management is solid, particularly with <strong>SQL</strong> and <strong>PostgreSQL</strong>, where I have utilized these skills to test databases and write comprehensive test cases. During my internship
         at <strong>ADA Analytics</strong>, I worked closely with the backend team to ensure the proper use of <strong>SQLAlchemy</strong> and developed specific requirements for database testing using <strong>PostgreSQL</strong>. This experience not only
          enhanced my technical skills but also taught me the importance of collaborating effectively within a team to achieve project goals.</p>
    
    <h1>Commitment to an Active and Balanced Lifestyle</h1>
    <p>Outside of my academic and professional pursuits, I am passionate about maintaining an active lifestyle. I enjoy playing <strong>soccer</strong> on a weekly basis, which helps me stay fit and fosters teamwork
         and strategic thinking. Additionally, I have a strong interest in <strong>weightlifting</strong> and work out five days a week. This dedication to fitness has instilled in me a sense of discipline, perseverance,
          and resilience, qualities that I bring to both my personal and professional endeavors. These activities not only keep me physically active but also provide a balance to my intense focus on 
          academics and technology.</p>

    <h1>Effective Communication and Collaborative Skills</h1>
    <p>In addition to my technical and fitness pursuits, I am also committed to maintaining a collaborative, supportive, and positive work environment. My experiences in various roles, 
        such as a <strong>File Clerk</strong> and <strong>Chat Helpline Support</strong> at Western University, have honed my communication skills and my ability to work well under pressure. I am fluent in both <strong>English</strong> and <strong>Arabic</strong>, 
        which allows me to connect with a diverse range of people. My attention to detail, reliability, and adaptability have consistently been strengths in every role I take on. 
        Looking forward, I am excited to continue my journey in computer science, blending my technical expertise with my commitment to collaboration, to contribute meaningfully to the field of
         <strong>data development</strong> and <strong>machine learning</strong>.</p>
