    ADA Analytics

<p> During my time at ADA Analytics from December to April, I had the exciting opportunity to work on the backend development team.<br> Our main project was an 
    ambitious overhaul of the company's website, aiming to revamp it based on new UX/UI prototypes we meticulously designed. 
</p>
<p>
    My contributions were centered around developing robust backend functionalities using FastAPI. I created efficient backend endpoints and ensured their 
    reliability through comprehensive unit tests using pytest. <br>Additionally, I documented all endpoint APIs and utilized Pydantic models for precise response 
    types, ensuring our system's integrity and scalability. <br> This experience not only honed my technical skills but also deepened my understanding of 
    integrating backend solutions with modern web design principles. <br> It was a highly rewarding and intellectually stimulating experience that enhanced my expertise 
    in backend development and web technologies.
